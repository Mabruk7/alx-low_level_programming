This is a README file for a C programming project on bit manipulation. The project contains six C functions and one file with a password. Each function has its own C file and prototype in the header file, and each function performs a specific task related to manipulating bits. The README file provides a brief overview of each function's task, its corresponding C file, and its prototype. There is also a folder with test files to test the functionality of the C functions.
